# HAZY

Welcome to hazy's public resources repository! In this repository, we aim to provide, in a centralised fashion, a set of open-sources resources that the hazy team has produced and believe could be of use the both the data-science community as well as the general.

Our hope is that by providing such resources, we can help speed up the developement of privacy-aware technologies and help ease the process of understanding the solutions we will be providing from now on.

Currently, this repository contains the following resources:
* Hazy's white paper on anonymisation
* Hazy's entity hierarchy structure
  * Interactive Visual Representation of the Hierarchy
  * YAML file containing the hierarchy.
